# Case Study: Numerical Methods for Root Finding in Engineering

## üìú Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive scientific report for the "Maths for Engineering" module, detailing an independent investigation into numerical methods for solving equations of the form `f(x) = 0`. Such root-finding problems are crucial in engineering and technology for understanding system behaviour.

The project involved in-depth research, implementation, and critical evaluation of three key numerical methods: Interval Bisection, the Rearrangement Method (Fixed Point Iteration), and the Newton-Raphson Method. The primary focus was on applying these methods to a specific polynomial function, analysing their performance, convergence, accuracy, and potential failure modes.

The study emphasises the practical application of these methods, the importance of initial graphical analysis (using tools like Desmos), and the iterative calculation process (managed with tools like Excel).

**The specific polynomial function investigated in this case study is:**
`f(x)= x^5  + 3.8x^4  - 46.7x^3  - 43.9x^2  + 103.5x + 48.1`
*(This function is known to have 5 real roots between x = -10 and +10).*
